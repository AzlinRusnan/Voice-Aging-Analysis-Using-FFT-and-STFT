## Introduction
This study compares the vocal characteristics of Siti Nurhaliza in 2001 and 2022 by analysing the song "Azimat Cinta." The analysis includes waveform analysis, Fourier Transform (FFT), Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), and average spectrum analysis to identify changes due to aging.

## Data
The data consists of two audio recordings of the song "Azimat Cinta" by Siti Nurhaliza, one from 2001 and another from 2022. These files are not included in the repository and should be obtained separately.

## Key Components

1. **Waveform Analysis**: 
   - Visualizes the time-domain representation of audio signals.
   - Compares the amplitude patterns of recordings from 2001 and 2022.
   - Reveals changes in vocal strength and expressive range.

2. **FFT Analysis**: 
   - Transforms time-domain signals into the frequency domain.
   - Identifies shifts in fundamental frequency and harmonic structure.
   - Highlights the reduction in vocal clarity and resonance over time.

3. **STFT Analysis**:
   - Provides a time-frequency representation of audio signals.
   - Examines the dynamic changes in frequency content over time.
   - Shows variations in harmonic bands, formant frequencies, and noise levels.
